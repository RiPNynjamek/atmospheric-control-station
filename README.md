# Introduction

This project is a system that turns on and off a fan and an humidifier in order to manage the temperature and humidity in a grow room via a Raspberry Pi setup. Basically no difference with Boston Dynamics' latest developments.

# Dependencies 
The code depends on : 
  * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DHT)
  * [libgpiod2 Linux package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgpiod2)

# Usage Example
## Hardware circuit wiring

The fan and the humidifier will be connected to the Relay Module, more details to come.
